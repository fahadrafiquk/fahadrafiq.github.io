font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Conserving Pakistan’s Native Livestock
Breeds: An Economic, Ecological, and Cultural Imperative</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Pakistan
is home to a rich diversity of livestock breeds – from hardy humped cattle
grazing the Punjab plains to sure-footed goats in the northern mountains. These
<b>native breeds</b> of cattle, buffalo, goats, and sheep are more than just
animals; they are a cornerstone of rural life and a living heritage. However,
in the pursuit of higher productivity, Pakistan’s indigenous livestock genetic
resources are increasingly under threat. This article explores why conserving
native breeds is so important economically, ecologically, and culturally,
examines current government policies and their impact, and highlights what more
can be done to safeguard these invaluable animals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Economic Significance of Indigenous Breeds</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Livestock
plays a <b>vital role in Pakistan’s economy and food security</b>. Over <b>8
million rural families</b> are engaged in raising livestock, which contributes
an estimated <b>35–40% of their household income</b>. Nationally, the livestock
sector now makes up about <b>60.8% of agricultural value added and 14.6% of
Pakistan’s GDP</b>. This includes cattle, buffaloes, goats, sheep and other
animals that provide milk, meat, eggs, wool, hides, and draught power. In
recent years, Pakistan’s livestock herd has grown steadily – as of 2023, the
country has about <b>57.5 million cattle, 46.3 million buffalo, 87.0 million
goats, and 32.7 million sheep</b> in total – a huge asset for the economy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Significantly,
<b>Pakistan’s native breeds</b> form the backbone of this livestock wealth. The
country has around <b>15 recognized breeds of cattle</b> (such as the Sahiwal,
Red Sindhi, Cholistani, Tharparkar, Achai and others), <b>five breeds of
buffalo</b> (including the famed Nili-Ravi and Kundhi), and dozens of breeds of
goats and sheep. In fact, Pakistan is reported to have <b>36 indigenous goat
breeds</b> – from the high-yielding <b>Beetal and Kamori</b> dairy goats to the
small hardy “desi” goats kept by landless farmers. Likewise, there may be over <b>30
distinct sheep breeds</b> adapted to various regions. This genetic diversity
has tremendous economic value. Many of these breeds are renowned for specific
productive traits: for example, <b>Sahiwal and Red Sindhi cattle</b> are
internationally acclaimed tropical dairy breeds known for high milk fat content
and heat tolerance, and the <b>Nili-Ravi buffalo</b> is prized for its
exceptional milk yield and rich milk used in local dairy products. Pakistan
“possesses breeds of livestock that are among the best in the world, with
traits of early maturity, climate adaptability, and quality meat” when properly
managed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Crucially,
<b>indigenous breeds support the livelihoods of millions of small farmers and
pastoralists</b>. In arid and semi-arid areas where crop farming is difficult,
livestock rearing is often the only viable source of income. For instance, in
the desert region of Tharparkar (Sindh) and the Cholistan desert of Punjab, <b>up
to 90% of the local population depends on livestock rearing for survival</b>.
These areas are home to hardy native cattle like the <b>Tharparkar (White
Sindhi/Kankrej)</b> and <b>Cholistani</b> breeds, which thrive in the harsh
climate. Farmers in these regions rely on their cattle, goats and sheep to
produce meat and milk that is sold or bartered for other essentials. Even in
more temperate zones, owning cows or buffaloes is akin to an insurance policy
and a source of daily cash flow (through milk sales) for rural families. In
short, the economic well-being of Pakistan’s rural economy is tightly
interwoven with its native livestock breeds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Despite
the large number of animals, Pakistan still struggles with gaps in productivity
– the country faces periodic meat and milk shortages, and imports dairy
products to meet demand. Livestock experts point out that <b>average yields of
local breeds are low (a cow may give only 5–6 liters of milk a day) compared to
20–40 liters from specialized breeds abroad</b>, largely due to limited past
efforts in systematic breed improvement. This indicates a huge untapped
potential: if native breeds were given proper attention, feeding and selective
breeding, their productivity could be improved significantly. The economic
payoff would be twofold – reducing reliance on costly imports (like powdered
milk) and improving farm incomes. As one farmers’ association leader noted,
Pakistan has “100 million animals” but needs to <b>invest in developing its
indigenous cattle and buffalo breeds</b> instead of simply importing exotic
cows or semen. In summary, conserving and improving local breeds is not just
about heritage – it makes sound economic sense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ecological and Environmental Importance</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Beyond
economics, <b>native livestock breeds are ecologically invaluable</b>. Over
centuries, Pakistan’s cattle, buffaloes, goats and sheep have been naturally or
selectively bred to survive and thrive in the country’s diverse landscapes –
from scorching deserts and floodplains to mountainous highlands. This makes
them <b>highly adapted to local environmental conditions</b>. Indigenous breeds
can efficiently utilize the sparse fodder and grazing available in marginal
lands where imported high-performance breeds would struggle or perish.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>For
example, in the rugged Hindu Kush mountains of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, small native
breeds like the <b>Achai cattle, Azikheli buffalo, and Kari sheep</b> form the
backbone of subsistence farming. These animals have evolved the ability to make
<b>optimal use of scarce, low-quality forage and navigate rough terrain</b>,
all while maintaining good fertility and production under stress. Researchers
note that such <b>indigenous mountain breeds</b> have remarkable endurance –
they can trek to high alpine pastures in summer, their smaller body size means
lower maintenance needs, and they can convert coarse browse into valuable milk,
meat and wool for local communities. In fact, when measured relative to body
size and feed input, these hardy animals often outperform larger exotic breeds
in difficult environments. Simply put, they are nature’s customized solutions
for food production in challenging climates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Similar
stories play out in Pakistan’s deserts and semi-arid rangelands. Native <b>Thari
(Tharparkar) cattle</b> and <b>Bargi camels</b> of the Thar desert, or the <b>Balochi
sheep</b> breeds of Balochistan, can survive on scrub vegetation and tolerate
extreme heat and drought. In Cholistan, the <b>Cholistani cattle breed</b> is
known for its tolerance to water scarcity and ability to graze on native
pastures. According to one report, these desert cattle have <b>high fertility
and calving rates</b>, and their calves grow quickly when raised on natural
grazing lands with native high-protein grasses. By contrast, exotic cattle or
high-producing crossbreds often cannot cope without intensive stall-feeding,
ample water, and climate-controlled sheds – inputs that are costly and often
impractical across Pakistan’s farmlands.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
<b>ecological significance</b> of conserving native breeds also extends to
maintaining biodiversity and resilient agro-ecosystems. Each indigenous breed
represents a unique genetic pool finely tuned to a specific habitat. Replacing
them with a narrow range of imported breeds could reduce genetic diversity and
make the livestock sector more vulnerable to diseases, pests, and climate
change. For instance, many local breeds have innate disease resistance or
tolerance to local parasites that highly bred foreign animals lack. Losing those
genes could mean losing natural defenses against livestock epidemics. Moreover,
indigenous livestock often play key roles in the ecosystem – their grazing
patterns can help manage vegetation and prevent bush encroachment, their manure
cycles nutrients in soils, and they often have lower carbon and water
footprints under free-range conditions than intensive commercial breeds do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In
the era of climate change, these hardy breeds might prove to be <b>assets for
adaptation</b>. As Pakistan faces rising temperatures, erratic rainfall and
more frequent droughts, the traits of native animals – heat tolerance, ability
to survive on poor fodder, walking long distances to find feed or water – are
invaluable. Conserving them is essentially preserving a <b>living gene bank</b>
for food security under changing environmental conditions. Any strategy for <b>sustainable
agriculture</b> and climate resilience should therefore include the
conservation of indigenous livestock alongside crops.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Cultural and Heritage Value</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Livestock
are deeply woven into the <b>cultural fabric of Pakistan</b>. For rural
communities, farm animals are not impersonal units of production – they are
often given names, cared for like family, and hold significant sentimental
value. Many indigenous breeds carry the legacy of the communities that
developed them, and are a source of <b>regional pride and identity</b>. For
example, the <b>Sahiwal cattle</b> take their name from the Sahiwal district
and have been a part of Punjabi farming heritage for generations; the <b>Red
Sindhi cattle</b> are emblematic of Sindh’s dairy traditions; and breeds like <b>Bhagnari</b>
or <b>Dhani</b> cattle are tied to the history of specific tribes and areas. In
pastoral societies, owning a fine camel or a strong bull of a local breed
elevates one’s status. Even the patterns and colors of certain sheep and goat
breeds have made their way into folk art and storytelling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Traditional
festivals and practices also highlight the cultural importance of native
breeds. During <b>Eid-ul-Azha (the annual festival of sacrifice)</b>, many
families specifically seek out handsome local breed animals – whether a Kajli
sheep with its distinctive ears or a big Nili-Ravi buffalo – for the Qurbani
sacrifice, as a matter of pride and religious devotion. Livestock fairs (such
as the historic <b>Sibi Mela</b> in Balochistan or local cattle shows in rural
Punjab) celebrate the best indigenous breeds, where farmers proudly parade
their finest Sahiwal cows, Makhi Cheeni goats, or Kundhi buffaloes. These fairs
are social events that keep rural traditions alive and facilitate exchange of
breeding animals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Moreover,
dairy and meat from native livestock are integral to Pakistan’s culinary
culture. The creamy milk of the buffalo – the country’s preferred dairy animal
– is the source of traditional products like desi ghee (clarified butter),
yogurt, lassi and sweets; it’s no coincidence that the <b>Nili-Ravi buffalo</b>
is often affectionately called “black gold” in Punjab for the wealth its milk
brings. Goat and sheep meats (mutton) from local breeds are central to many
Pakistani dishes and feasts. By conserving the breeds, we also conserve the
unique flavors and qualities of these foods that have been perfected over time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In
essence, each indigenous breed is a living repository of cultural history and
social value. Allowing these breeds to die out would mean erasing an important
part of our heritage – like losing an old craft or language. The cultural bond
between Pakistani farmers and their native livestock cannot be measured in
rupees alone, but it certainly strengthens the social fabric of rural life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Current Government Policies and Their
Impact</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Pakistan’s
government recognizes the importance of the livestock sector and has taken
initiatives to boost its productivity. The national strategy in recent years
has focused on <b>increasing milk and meat production</b> to meet domestic
demand and even turn Pakistan into an exporter of animal products. A key
element of this strategy is <b>“breed improvement for enhanced productivity”</b>
– essentially improving animal genetics to get higher yields. In theory, this
includes <b>identifying high-performing indigenous breeds adapted to each
agro-ecological zone</b> and establishing “nucleus herds” (breeding centers)
for them, as well as <b>importing high-yielding exotic dairy, beef and mutton
breeds and genetic material</b> (like semen and embryos) to cross with local
stock.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>On
paper, this approach tries to balance leveraging local breeds with introducing
foreign genetics. In practice, however, the <b>emphasis has tilted heavily
towards exotic breed introduction and cross-breeding</b>, with less tangible
support for purebred indigenous lines. Thousands of doses of Holstein-Friesian
cattle semen have been imported to inseminate local cows, and large commercial
dairy farms have brought in foreign-bred animals for higher milk output. While
these cross-breeding programs can improve yields in controlled environments,
they also raise concerns about the <b>genetic dilution of native breeds</b>.
Experts note that indiscriminate cross-breeding, if not well-managed, can
swiftly erode the pure populations of local cattle and buffalo – meaning the
unique traits of indigenous breeds get lost as they are mixed with imported
bloodlines.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>When
it comes to <b>conservation of native breeds</b>, government action has been
limited and fragmented. There have been some positive policy signals: for
instance, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provincial government released a Livestock
Policy in 2018 that explicitly made <b>“preservation of indigenous livestock
breeds” a priority</b> alongside genetic improvement. This policy emphasizes
conserving animal genetic resources and even mentions establishing breed
conservation programs. Other provinces have breeding programs at government
livestock farms (for example, maintaining herds of Sahiwal cattle and Nili-Ravi
buffalo at research stations) and some initiatives to register breeds. The
federal Ministry of National Food Security &amp; Research has also acknowledged
the need to <b>identify and conserve well-adapted local breeds</b> in its
plans.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>However,
<b>implementation on the ground has lagged</b>. Breed conservation and
improvement units are often under-resourced. There is no comprehensive national
gene bank for livestock (though small-scale semen banks exist for a few major
breeds), and many smaller breeds have no formal conservation plan at all. A
telling indicator is that while crossbred and exotic cattle populations have
risen to form a significant share of the national herd, the proportion of pure
indigenous cattle has not grown correspondingly, and some breeds have seen
declines. In Sindh province, for example, academicians and farmers have raised
alarms that <b>local cattle breeds are “fast becoming endangered”</b> as their
numbers dwindle. Experts at Sindh Agriculture University recently warned of
“rapidly declining population of buffaloes, goats and purebred breeds of
various livestock, including sheep” in the province. Similar concerns echo in
other regions – Pakistan’s native breeds are steadily being replaced or
crossbred without plans to maintain pure lines.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
<b>impact of current policies</b> can thus be viewed as a double-edged sword.
On one hand, efforts to improve productivity are understandable given the need
for food security and economic growth. Pakistan’s livestock sector grew almost
3.9% in 2023-24, buoyed by these initiatives. On the other hand, without strong
safeguards, these same policies can undermine genetic diversity. For example,
government support or subsidies for imported breeds (or their semen) makes it
attractive for farmers to abandon local breeds. A lack of investment in <b>selective
breeding programs for indigenous stock</b> – e.g. systematically improving
Sahiwal cattle milk yield generation after generation – means local breeds
remain low yielding, perpetuating the cycle of farmers preferring crossbreds or
imports. <b>Inadequate research and extension services</b> for local breed
management exacerbate this gap. Dairy farmers have pointed out that Pakistan
has not done enough research on improving local cows and buffaloes, unlike a
country like India which has invested in technology (such as sexed semen for
indigenous breeds) to boost their performance. The result is a continued
perception that indigenous animals are “inferior” – a view that can become a
self-fulfilling prophecy if those breeds are neglected.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It’s
worth noting that the government and academia are starting to respond to these
concerns. The establishment of the <b>National Centre for Livestock Breeding,
Genetics and Genomics</b> with sub-centers in various provinces is a recent
step. In October 2021, a sub-center in Tandojam, Sindh, announced plans to <b>conserve
the pure genetic stock of local cattle, buffalo, goat, and sheep breeds</b>,
including creating a repository of reproductive material (semen, embryos) for
rare breeds. They even plan to use DNA testing to verify and catalog pure
breeds in the province. These are promising moves, but still in nascent stages.
The challenge remains to scale up such efforts nationally and integrate them
with the mainstream livestock development programs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Gaps in Conservation Strategies and
Consequences of Neglect</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>A
critical look at Pakistan’s current approach reveals several <b>gaps in its
strategy for conserving native livestock breeds</b>:</span></p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-family:
     "Times New Roman",serif'>Insufficient In-Situ Conservation:</span></b><span
     style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> There are few incentive
     programs to encourage farmers to keep breeding populations of pure
     indigenous animals. Most conservation herds are limited to government
     farms or research stations, which alone cannot cover the genetic breadth
     of breeds found across villages. Without engaging the “custodian” farming
     communities, it is difficult to maintain viable population sizes of
     certain breeds on the brink.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-family:
     "Times New Roman",serif'>Lack of Breeding Plans for Improvement:</span></b><span
     style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> While cross-breeding gets
     attention, <b>selective breeding within indigenous breeds</b> (to enhance
     their milk, meat, or growth performance) has been relatively neglected.
     This is a missed opportunity – strategic selection and better husbandry
     could significantly improve yields of native breeds over time, as seen
     with breed improvement programs in other countries. The absence of such
     programs means local breeds’ productivity gap versus exotics remains
     large, reinforcing the trend of switching to crossbreds.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-family:
     "Times New Roman",serif'>Data and Monitoring Deficits:</span></b><span
     style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> There is no recent nationwide
     livestock breed census detailing the population of each breed (the last
     detailed livestock census was in 2006). Many breeds, especially minor
     ones, could be declining unnoticed. For instance, experts noted that the <b>Dajal
     cattle</b> of Punjab hardly appeared in official counts and are at risk of
     vanishing. Without updated data or breed registries, policy-makers cannot
     easily identify which breeds need urgent intervention.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-family:
     "Times New Roman",serif'>Cross-breeding Without Safeguards:</span></b><span
     style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> In many areas, farmers
     practice indiscriminate cross-breeding – e.g. using whatever bull or
     artificial insemination is available – with little guidance. This has led
     to <b>genetic erosion</b> in some breeds. For example, in the highlands, <b>lack
     of pure breeding males and uncontrolled cross-mating</b> has diluted the
     once-distinct Achai cattle and other mountain breeds. There is a lack of
     guidelines or enforcement on maintaining breed purity in designated home
     tracts.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-family:
     "Times New Roman",serif'>Resource Constraints:</span></b><span
     style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> Financing and expertise for
     conservation is limited. Establishing gene banks, running breed
     development programs, or even maintaining existing government herds
     require funds and trained personnel. These often take a backseat to more
     immediate productivity-focused projects.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>If
these gaps persist, the <b>consequences of neglecting native breeds</b> could
be severe. Most obviously, Pakistan risks losing many of its indigenous breeds
altogether – a number of them could go <b>extinct or quasi-extinct</b> in the
coming decades, as has happened in other countries. This would be an
irreversible loss of biodiversity. With each breed that disappears, we lose
unique genes that could have been crucial for disease resistance, climate
adaptation, or future scientific research (for example, studying a
drought-resistant goat to breed drought tolerance into other lines). It narrows
the genetic base of our food system, making it more <b>vulnerable to shocks</b>.
A disease outbreak, for instance, could wipe out a uniform population of
crossbreds, whereas a diverse genetic pool might contain some resistant
animals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>From
an economic standpoint, overly relying on a few high-yield breeds can backfire.
Exotic dairy cows or hybrid poultry often need optimal conditions – quality
feed, healthcare, moderate climate – and can falter if those conditions are not
met. Small farmers who abandon hardy local breeds for such animals might find
themselves in trouble if they cannot afford the required inputs or if, say, a
heat wave strikes. The result could be lower overall productivity and higher
costs in the long run, undermining the very goal of the breed improvement
policy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Socially
and culturally, neglecting native breeds could erode rural traditions and
pride. Future generations may never see a pure Makhi Cheeni goat or a true
Sindhi buffalo if those go extinct – a disconnect from our agricultural
heritage. The knowledge associated with rearing those breeds (traditional
veterinary remedies, grazing and breeding practices adapted locally) would also
fade, which is a loss of intangible cultural knowledge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Another
consequence is increased <b>dependency on foreign sources</b> for genetics and
even dairy products. Already, Pakistan spends precious foreign exchange to
import milk powder and high-producing cattle. If local breeds are not developed
to be productive and only exotics are seen as the solution, the country could
become permanently beholden to external genetics companies for semen or live
animals. This has implications for national sovereignty over food production.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In
summary, failing to act on conservation can lead to <b>genetic homogenization,
ecological fragility, economic vulnerability, and cultural loss</b>. The
warning signs are visible – experts are raising concern over declining breed
populations – and the time to strengthen conservation efforts is now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Recommendations to Enhance Conservation
Efforts</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Conserving
Pakistan’s native livestock breeds will require a multi-pronged approach
involving policy measures, scientific programs, and community engagement. Here
are some <b>practical steps and recommendations</b> to help safeguard these
breeds for the future:</span></p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-family:
     "Times New Roman",serif'>Develop a National Indigenous Breeds Conservation
     Plan:</span></b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> The
     federal and provincial governments, with experts, should formulate a clear
     plan that identifies all indigenous livestock breeds and categorizes their
     conservation status (common, at-risk, critical). This plan should set
     targets to maintain or increase the population of endangered breeds and
     outline responsibilities for each stakeholder in achieving this.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-family:
     "Times New Roman",serif'>Strengthen In-Situ Conservation:</span></b><span
     style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> <b>Empower farming
     communities</b> to be partners in conservation. This could include
     financial incentives or subsidies for farmers who keep purebred indigenous
     animals of endangered breeds (e.g. cash support per breeding female of a
     rare breed, or provision of free veterinary care). Forming “breed
     societies” or community breeding groups can help villagers pool resources
     to maintain breeding males and avoid inbreeding. Successful models exist
     where communities take pride in sustaining their local breed and get
     recognition and support for doing so.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-family:
     "Times New Roman",serif'>Expand Ex-Situ Conservation:</span></b><span
     style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> The government should invest
     in <b>ex-situ measures like gene banks</b> and research farm herds.
     Collect and preserve semen, ova, and embryos from all important breeds
     (even those with small populations) for long-term storage. If a breed’s
     numbers crash, these genetic materials could be used to regenerate it.
     Additionally, each province’s livestock department can maintain nucleus
     herds of their major local breeds – not just for demonstration, but as
     active improvement herds where the best animals are bred and selected.
     These herds can supply high-quality purebred bulls or semen back to
     farmers to improve local stocks.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-family:
     "Times New Roman",serif'>Controlled and Smart Breeding Policies:</span></b><span
     style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> Rather than an uncontrolled
     flood of cross-breeding, Pakistan can implement a <b>structured breeding
     policy</b> that balances improvement and conservation. For dairy cattle,
     for example, one strategy is <b>cross-breeding in a graded but limited way</b>
     (like using 50% crossbreds for higher milk yield in commercial farms),
     while simultaneously <b>maintaining pure lines</b> of Sahiwal, Red Sindhi,
     and others. Any cross-breeding program should be closely monitored, and
     purebred population of each local breed should be maintained above a
     minimum threshold. The <b>Punjab Livestock Breeding Act</b> and similar
     regulations should enforce standards on artificial insemination services
     to ensure breed integrity is not inadvertently lost.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-family:
     "Times New Roman",serif'>Breed Improvement through Research and
     Technology:</span></b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>
     As farmers have urged, <b>invest in research to improve native breeds</b>
     rather than only looking outward. This can include modern reproductive
     technologies <i>for</i> indigenous breeds – for instance, producing <b>sexed
     semen</b> of Sahiwal or Nili-Ravi so farmers can get more female calves
     from these breeds, or using genomic selection to pick genetically superior
     local animals for breeding. Collaboration with countries like India, which
     has made strides in developing native breed semen production, or
     international organizations (FAO, ILRI) can bring in expertise.
     Universities and research institutes should get funding to study
     indigenous breed genetics, productivity, and management in depth, and to
     pilot innovations (such as improved feed regimes that boost local breed
     milk yields).</span></li>

     underperform simply because of traditional management (poor nutrition,
     health issues). By launching targeted <b>training programs for farmers</b>
     on better feeding (e.g. grow fodder crops, mineral supplementation),
     disease prevention, and breeding timing, the productivity of native breeds
     can be enhanced without genetic change. For example, educating
     pastoralists in desert areas on supplemental feeding during droughts can
     prevent weight loss in their cattle and keep fertility rates up.
     Demonstration farms that showcase how a well-fed Sahiwal cow can give
     respectable milk yields would help change mindsets that only exotics are
     “good”.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-family:
     "Times New Roman",serif'>Utilize Native Breeds for Niche Markets:</span></b><span
     style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> Another way to make
     conservation economically sustainable is to develop <b>niche markets for
     products from indigenous breeds</b>. This could be branding and marketing
     the milk from Sahiwal or Red Sindhi cows as a premium product (some
     evidence suggests milk from zebu breeds has A2 type proteins, which are in
     demand). Similarly, wool from indigenous sheep or the unique tastes of meat
     from certain goat breeds can be marketed to fetch higher prices. If
     farmers see they can earn more by keeping their local breed pure, they
     will have a direct incentive to do so. Exporting breeding stock or genetic
     material of indigenous breeds (in a controlled manner) is another
     potential: Pakistan could earn revenue as there is international interest
     in hardy tropical breeds (for example, Sahiwal cattle have been exported
     to Africa and Australia in the past). But this must be coupled with
     growing enough stock at home first.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-family:
     "Times New Roman",serif'>Awareness and Cultural Preservation:</span></b><span
     style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> A softer but important aspect
     is <b>raising public awareness</b> about the importance of native breeds.
     This can be done through school curricula (learning about local farm
     animals), media campaigns, and cultural events. Celebrating success
     stories – like a farmer who improved his herd of local goats and made
     profits – can inspire others. The government and NGOs could organize more
     competitions and fairs that highlight indigenous breeds, awarding prizes
     for the best specimens of Sahiwal cattle, Kamori goats, etc. Such
     recognition boosts pride in local breeds and encourages more people to
     take up their rearing. Preserving folklore, proverbs, and stories about
     these animals also keeps the cultural connection strong.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-family:
     "Times New Roman",serif'>Monitoring and Evaluation:</span></b><span
     style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> Finally, any conservation
     effort should include a system to <b>monitor breed populations and health
     annually</b>, and evaluate the effectiveness of measures taken. The
     revival of a livestock census or the use of digital registries can help
     track changes in breed numbers. If a breed’s count is still falling,
     strategies need adjustment; if another is thriving, understand why and
     replicate those conditions elsewhere. Regular reporting on the state of
     animal genetic resources (as per Pakistan’s obligations under the Global
     Plan of Action for Animal Genetic Resources) will keep the issue on the
     radar of policy-makers.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>By
implementing these measures, Pakistan can move toward a more balanced livestock
development paradigm – one that not only seeks immediate productivity gains but
also <b>safeguards the genetic foundation of its livestock industry</b>. Other
countries have shown that development and conservation can go hand in hand; for
example, India and Brazil have improved milk production while conserving native
cattle breeds, and many African nations are investing in local breed
resilience. Pakistan too can chart a path that harnesses the best of its own
breeds alongside selective use of exotic genetics, rather than one that
inadvertently replaces the former with the latter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Conclusion</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Our
native livestock breeds are a <b>national treasure</b> hiding in plain sight –
living assets that have fed and supported our people for centuries. They are
economically vital for rural livelihoods, ecologically suited to our lands, and
culturally precious. Conserving them is not a nostalgic luxury; it is essential
for sustainable agriculture, future food security, and resilience against
climate and market upheavals. Pakistan’s current policies acknowledge the
importance of livestock but must broaden in vision to explicitly protect and
improve indigenous breeds. As we push to produce more milk and meat, we should
remember that <b>breed “improvement” should not come at the cost of breed
extinction</b>. There is a need for course-correction and greater investment in
the often undervalued native breeds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
encouraging news is that Pakistan still has time and many dedicated individuals
– farmers, scientists, policymakers – who are aware of the problem and eager to
act. By making breed conservation a public priority and backing it with
concrete support, Pakistan can ensure that its <b>Sahiwal cattle continue to
roam the pastures, Nili-Ravi buffaloes continue to wallow in the rivers, and
vibrant local goats and sheep continue to thrive on our rangelands</b> for
generations to come. The loss of a breed is permanent, but so is the impact of
saving one. It is an effort well worth making, for the sake of our economy, our
environment, and our heritage.</span></p>
